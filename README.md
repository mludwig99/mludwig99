### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is MichaÅ‚
Over two years ago I decided to change my career path. I bet on the IT industries. There were several reasons, including the fact that in my childhood I was interested in issues related to computer hardware and how to overclock it;)
At It, I also have friends who sometimes tell me about their work. I started with Python first and then learned technologies related to working as a Front End Developer. I learned from accessible sources and online courses, including Udemy. I also completed a Bootcamp at Akademia108. During the training I learned about such issues and technologies as advanced CSS (SASS pre-processor), JavaScript (JS-DOM, jQery, AJAX), Bootstrap Library, Git (GitHub - Git Bash), WordPress (Creating a child theme, overwriting a theme, templates, WP_Qery loop, shortcodes), React Library (Virtual DOM, components, their properties and life cycle, Hooks). The training allowed me to systematize my knowledge and put me on the right track. Currently focusing on Vanilla JS. In the future, I would like to improve in React and TypeScript.

I am looking for a job or an internship. Thanks to this, I will be able to concentrate more on learning and development in the chosen direction. On its part, it guarantees commitment and high motivation to work.

Skills: JS / REACT / HTML / CSS/WordPress
