### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is MichaÅ‚
Over two years ago I decided to change my career path. I bet on the IT. There were several reasons, including fact, that in my childhood I was interested in issues related to computer hardware and how to overclock it ;) I also have some friends who works in IT role, and they tell me about their job. I started with Python first and then learned technologies related to working as a Front End Developer. I learned from accessible sources and online courses, including Udemy (it allowed me to check, if I want and can do it in my future job). I also completed the Bootcamp at Akademia108. During the training I learned about such issues and technologies, as advanced CSS (SASS pre-processor), JavaScript (JS-DOM, jQery, AJAX), Bootstrap Library, Git (GitHub - Git Bash), WordPress (Creating a child theme, overwriting a theme, templates, WP_Qery loop, shortcodes), React Library (Virtual DOM, components, their properties and life cycle, Hooks). The training allowed me to systematize my knowledge, put me on the right track and the most important, how to search and where can I find the information I need. I also enrolled in a private two-year engineering school for programmers. Currently focusing on Vanilla JS. In the future, I would like to improve in React and TypeScript.

I am looking for my first job or internship. Thanks to this, I will be able to concentrate more on learning and development in the chosen direction. On its part, it guarantees commitment and high motivation to work.
